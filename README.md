# Jigsaw - Toxic Comment Classification
Overall objective: Multi-label classification of text into various categories of toxicity

As part of the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge ([https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge]) machine learning competition held on kaggle.com[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions], I used a set of different neural network architectures to model the data. The Google Collab. Jupyter notebook in this repo contains a single Keras model for the network architecture bidirectional LSTM - 1-D CNN - bidirectional LSTM - 1-D CNN with Fasttext frozen embedding and Adam optimizer (details in notebook).

The final submission was an ensemble model which incorporated the solution from this script and from other network architectures and embeddings. Will add an exploratory data analysis in the near future.
